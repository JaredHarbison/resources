### Figma
I started with Figma to simply grab the SVG from some text for the logo animation on my website. Since then, I've explored Figma a bit more and I've grown to appreciate how quickly I can skeleton a website in a better way than a typical wireframe. With Figma I can use any images I plan to use on the site and get a better idea of how the styling is aligning with the content.
